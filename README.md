#ABOUT GRAND PROJECT


NOTE : It is better to run this file on COLAB as it already contain all the libraries used and no download have to be made in PC .


This Directory Contain 5 files.

1- Two DATASET files (credit_loan and Main)

2- EDA File have all the preprocessing , EDA , feature engineering and Model fitting (RandomForrestClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier) which were tested on the Credit_loan DATASET.

3- Model File have the best performing Model and it was Fitted on Main.csv DATASET (which is typically same credit_loan dataset but is preprocessed).

4- Futher Model.pynb aslo generates a pickle file for fitted model and then it gets passed to Gradio.

5- The purpose of pickle file is not having to fit the model every time a code and that model can be directly accessed by through that pickle file

6- Gradio is a python library for deployment of ML models .

7- When the last cell is run on Model.pynb it prints two things FIRST A LINK and SECOND the UI of MODEL .

8- Model can be accessed there as it is 

9- But a better OPTION is to click on the link which will open a live hosting of that FITTED MODEL.
  
  
- This is a 1 set of value to make prediction on the model and AFTER entering these values model should return 'You Are Not Eligible For Loan'

##LMS (Library Management System )

There are 4 profiles with Id and Password to login to LMS

id = ibrahim
password = 888


id = hasnain
password = 777


id= ali
password = 444


id = uzaifa
password = 123@44

Then inside the LMS we have a HEAD bar that have a watch logo if clicked directs you to a time log.

In LMS we three windows :

1 - collection -> which basically have all the collections of books in library.

2 - returned  -> which have entry field if some one is returning a book

3 - sanction -> this window has enrty field to sanction someone a book in the library.

for Sanctioning and Returning a book members name and id is required for we have two members who can take a book and return it .

member name = mannan
id = ####


member name = hassan
id = pokemon
