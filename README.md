Important notice logout button doesn't work rightnow as I made code messy and sorting it out become very difficult in the end.
And the clock on the header is a button that tells login-time
And there are link of directories / folders of pictures used in this gui so it may cause trouble to run in an alien computer
all the pictures used are there in folder of LMS.
Thank You!
